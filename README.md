# Post Grad Self-Study Programming Lessons

Welcome to my post-graduate self-study programming lessons repository! Here, I document my journey of continuous learning and improvement in programming skills. Below is an overview of the contents of this repository:

## Classes w/ Unittests

In this folder, you'll find practice classes and the corresponding unit tests. I focus on writing robust and efficient code while ensuring its correctness through unit testing. This section helps me strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming principles and test-driven development.

## Data Structures

This folder contains my solutions to assignments from CS1332, a course offered by Georgia Tech, focusing on data structures. By tackling these assignments, I aim to deepen my understanding of fundamental data structures such as lists, trees, heaps, and graphs. Through hands-on implementation and analysis, I strive to enhance my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Basic Python problems

Here, I engage in practicing Python programming, particularly focusing on problems involving loops and arrays. These exercises enable me to sharpen my skills in writing clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code. As I progress, I plan to explore various Python libraries and advanced topics to broaden my knowledge and capabilities.

Feel free to explore the content of each folder and provide any feedback or suggestions. Together, let's embark on this journey of continuous learning and growth in the world of programming!
